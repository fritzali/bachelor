			{Expected neutrino fluence normalized to the maximum charm contribution from a~young magnetar for different time
			 intervals after formation, including the optical depth defined by \eqref{eqn:optical} as a modification.
			 Charmed hadrons dominate at all energies~except below $E_\nu = \kern-0.5pt \qty{e7}{\giga\electronvolt}$ for the
			 $\qty{e4}{\second} - \kern-1.0pt \qty{e5}{\second}$ integration. This is unexpected and therefore discussed below.
			 The same shaded uncertainty band as in Figure \ref{fig:magnetar-flux-with} is adopted for charm decays.
			 Fluences are scaled by a factor $E_\nu^2$ for clarity and to facilitate the comparison to \cite{Carpio_2020}.}
