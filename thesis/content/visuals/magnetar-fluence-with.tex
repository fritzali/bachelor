			{Expected neutrino fluence weighted by the charm contribution from a~young magnetar for different time
			 intervals after formation, including the optical depth defined by \eqref{eqn:optical} as a modification.
			 Charmed hadrons dominate at all energies~except below $E_\nu = \kern-0.5pt \qty{e7}{\giga\electronvolt}$ for
			 $\qty{e4}{\second} - \kern-1.0pt \qty{e5}{\second}$ integration. This is unexpected and therefore discussed further
			 in the text. The same shaded uncertainty band as in Figure \ref{fig:magnetar-flux-with} is adopted for charm decays.}
