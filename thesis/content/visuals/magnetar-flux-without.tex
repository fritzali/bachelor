			{Effective neutrino light curves normalized to the maximum charm decay flux at
			 $E_\nu = \kern-0.5pt \qty{e9}{\giga\electronvolt}$ from a newborn magnetar, excluding the optical depth
			 defined by \eqref{eqn:optical} as a modification. Properties of hadronic components in agreement with
			 Figure \ref{fig:magnetar-flux-with} are observed. Different shapes that are also seen in Figure
			 \ref{fig:magnetar-charm-comparison-without} agree with cooling and the omission of an optical depth 
			 as Section \ref{sub:cooling} describes, and lead to pion and charm peaks with larger magnitudes.
			 The same shaded uncertainty band as in Figure \ref{fig:magnetar-flux-with} is adopted for charm decays.}
