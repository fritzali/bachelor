			{Comparison of individual charmed hadron contributions to the total charm neutrino fluence
			 from an AGN accretion disk. Hadronic components similar to Figures \ref{fig:magnetar-flux-with}
			 and \ref{fig:magnetar-flux-without} are found, where earlier times correspond to higher energies
			 in these cases. Cooling becomes significant at lower energies for larger decay times, which leads
			 to $D^0$ decreasing at a higher energy than $D^+ \kern-0.5pt$ decays, for example.}
