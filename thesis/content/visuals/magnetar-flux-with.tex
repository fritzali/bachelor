			{Effective neutrino light curves normalized to the maximum charm decay flux at
			 $E_\nu = \kern-0.5pt \qty{e9}{\giga\electronvolt}$ from a newborn magnetar, including the optical depth
			 defined by \eqref{eqn:optical} as a modification. Charmed hadrons dominate up to $t = \kern-0.5pt \qty{e5}{\second}$
			 with pion contributions below those from kaons at all times. A cutoff after $t = \kern-0.5pt \qty{e6}{\second}$ occurs
			 due to insufficient proton energies. For the charm component, a shaded error band of factor $1 \kern-0.5pt /3 - 3$
			 is adopted to replicate uncertainties from \cite{Carpio_2020}.}
