Many thanks are also due to Marcel Schroller, who guided me through this complex subject

Special thanks also go to David Pape, who took the time to thoroughly check my work
for linguistic correctness and provided me with helpful advice.

Moreover, I wish to express my gratitude to all those who have welcomed and helped me in
both Bochum and Dortmund, of whom there are too many to mention.

Lastly, I want to thank my parents for their continued support, especially my mother,
who has enabled me to concentrate fully on writing this thesis over the last few weeks.
