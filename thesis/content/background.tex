\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}

On their journey through space, messenger particles are subject to various influences, both in terms of type and scale,
before reaching our planet. Understanding this propagation requires a thorough comprehension of physical processes at all
scales of application, from production in astrophysical sources, through interactions with the vast radiation and matter
fields that fill the cosmos, to entering the solar system and ultimately the terrestrial atmosphere. The following sections
provide an incomplete overview of aspects relevant to the treatment of this complex topic, as well as references for further
study on the various related subjects.



\section{Particle Physics}
\label{sec:particle}

In our modern view, interactions and categories of elementary particles are most accurately described by a construct called the
\emph{Standard Model} (SM) of particle physics. Underlying this formalism is the mathematical framework known as
\emph{Quantum Field Theory}~(QF{\kern+0.5pt}T{\kern+0.5pt}) that combines and generalizes properties of
\emph{Quantum Mechanics}~(QM) and \emph{Special Relativity}~(SR) to produce a consistent description of microscopic reality.
Excitations in the associated fields are referred to as quanta and manifest themselves as observable particles.
Since this work is mostly concerned with the statistical behaviour of large quantities instead of individual particle probabilistics,
a more detailed treatment is omitted, with the exception of certain phenomena important to the justification of some later assumptions.



\subsection{Reference Frames}
\label{sub:frames}

Depending on the application, energies in particle physics are either given as viewed from a suitable rest frame or independent from
the choice of coordinates altogether. One particularly convenient formulation uses incoming and outgoing momenta
$p_1 , \kern-1.0pt p_2$ and $p_3 \kern+0.5pt , \kern-1.0pt p_4$ to define
\begin{align*}
	s = \bigl( p_1 \kern-0.5pt + p_2 \bigr)^2 \kern+0.5pt , &&
	t = \bigl( p_1 \kern-0.5pt - p_3 \bigr)^2 \kern+0.5pt , &&
	u = \bigl( p_1 \kern-0.5pt - p_4 \bigr)^2
\end{align*}
as the Mandelstam variables, which assign different channels to scattering processes based on the squared momentum carried by an
exchanged mediating particle. Implied in this context is a Minkowski inner product, making the above quantities manifestly Lorentz
invariant.
{\newpage}
When working with parametrizations defined for use in different subdisciplines, it often becomes necessary to convert from center
of mass energies $\sqrt{s \kern+1.0pt} \kern+1.0pt$ to the energy $\kern-0.5pt E \kern+1.0pt$ of a projectile as viewed in the
stationary target coordinate system, where vectors $P = (E \kern+1.0pt , \bm{P} \kern+0.75pt c)$ and $p = (m c^2 \kern-1.0pt , 0)$
measure the respective particle momenta. With $\bm{P}$ denoting a classical projectile momentum, as well as rest masses $M$ and $m$
for projectile and target, the relation $E^2 = \bm{P}^2 c^2 + M^2 c^4$ leads to
\begin{equation*}
	s = (P + p)^2 = (E + m c^2)^2 - \bm{P}^2 c^2 = 2E m c^2 + \kern+1.0pt m^2 c^4 + M^2 c^4
\end{equation*}
for the invariant mass. The trailing terms in this equation become negligible at high energies, allowing for an approximation
$s = 2E m c^2$ in the target rest frame.



\subsection{Fundamental Interactions}
\label{sub:interactions}

With the theory of \emph{Quantum Electrodynamics} (QED) representing a quantized description of classical electromagnetism, the
first successful QF{\kern+0.5pt}T formulation had been realized. It governs all interactions between electrical charges that involve
photons and predicts observations with extremely high precision. Each subsequent QF{\kern+0.5pt}T is built on a foundation of QED
achievements, such as \emph{Quantum Chromodynamics} (QCD) for strong force interactions or the unified framework of
\emph{Electroweak Theory} (EWT) that includes both weak force and electromagnetic phenomena.

According to the SM formalism, these interactions are mediated by bosonic elementary particles, namely massless photons
$\gamma \kern+0.75pt$ for electrodynamics or gluons $\kern-0.5pt g$ in case of the strong force sector, as well as massive
$Z$ and $W^\pm$ bosons that carry the weak force. The only remaining fundamental interaction not contained in the SM is gravity,
the effects of which are currently best described in terms of \emph{General Relativity} (GR{\kern+0.25pt}) as the continuous
macroscopic curvature of spacetime due to the presence of large masses. Because elementary particles exclusively inhabit
microscopic scales, their behavior is usually indistinguishable from that described by SR in flat space.



\subsection{Hadrons \& Leptons}
\label{sub:hadrons}

In addition to the previously listed gauge bosons, the SM further includes elementary fermions as the fundamental constituents of
matter. These sort into the categories of quarks and leptons, both of which are further grouped by generations of quark or lepton
pairs. Ordered according to their generation, there are flavors of up and down, charm and strange, as well as top and bottom for
quarks, which are denoted by their initial letters. For charged leptons, there exist electrons $e$ as well as the heavier muon
$\kern-0.5pt \mu$ and tau $\kern-0.5pt \tau \kern+0.5pt$ that each have an associated neutrino $\nu \kern+0.5pt$ with no electrical
charge. This picture is completed by the corresponding antiquarks and antileptons for all particles mentioned above.

Apart from an electrical charge, quarks are also carriers of so-called color charges that couple to gluons, which, in contrast
to the electrically neutral photons, carry colors themselves. Gluons are therefore capable of self-{\kern+0.25pt}coupling,
leading to higher binding energies with increasing distances. If removed far enough, this energy is eventually
released by producing a quark pair, ultimately leading to the creation of bound color-neutral states.

These resulting composite particles are called hadrons, with the entire process being referred to as hadronization. This naturally
leads to the concept of confinement, which states that quarks cannot exist as free particles, with the notable exception of very
high energies. In these regimes, strong force coupling becomes small and allows quarks to behave almost freely, defining the term
asymptotic freedom. A major consequence of this is that perturbative QCD calculations become possible, which would otherwise
require complex approaches such as discrete QCD on a lattice or some type of effective field theory instead.

In the quark model, hadrons can be divided into classes based on constituent numbers. Baryons are comprised of three quarks, all
with different colors, while mesons contain two quarks with opposite color and anticolor charges. From spin addition, it is clear
that baryons obey fermionic statistics, while mesons act as bosons. Exemplary quark contents are given for baryons such as protons
$p \equiv uud \kern+0.5pt$ and neutrons $n \equiv udd \kern+0.5pt$ as well as pions
$\pi^- \kern-1.0pt \equiv \kern+0.75pt \overline{\kern-0.5pt u \kern+0.5pt} d \kern+0.5pt$ and kaons
$K^- \kern-1.0pt \equiv \kern+0.75pt \overline{\kern-0.5pt u \kern+0.5pt} s \kern+0.5pt$ in the case of mesons.
The charmed hadrons considered in this work are the same mesons
$D^0 \kern-0.75pt \equiv c \kern+1.25pt \overline{\kern-0.5pt u \kern+0.5pt} \kern+0.5pt$ as well as
$D^- \kern-1.0pt \equiv \kern+0.5pt \overline{\kern-0.25pt c \kern+0.75pt} d \kern+0.5pt$
and $D^-_s \kern-1.0pt \equiv \kern+0.5pt \overline{\kern-0.25pt c \kern+0.75pt} s \kern+0.5pt$
with the baryon $\Lambda^{\kern-0.5pt +}_{\kern+0.5pt c} \kern-0.5pt \equiv u \kern+0.5pt d \kern+0.5pt c \kern+0.5pt$
as in \cite{Carpio_2020}. Specific decay channels will be listed directly in the relevant sections
with \cite{pdg} providing a broad overview.



\subsection{Particle Collisions}
\label{sub:collisions}

Cross Sections



\subsection{Cooling \& Decay}
\label{sub:cooling}

Consider an infinitesimally thin slice of a target medium with particle number density $n$ and volume $V \kern-0.1pt = S \kern+1.5pt dx$
where $S \kern+0.5pt$ and $dx$ measure surface area and thickness, respectively. Accordingly, there exist $\tilde{N} \kern-1.1pt = nV$
targets that each have effective interaction cross sections $\tilde{\sigma}$ with a total coverage of $\tilde{S} = \tilde{\sigma} \tilde{N}$
as viewed by an incident projectile.

The probability for stopping such a beam constituent then corresponds to the ratio $\mathscr{P} = \tilde{S} / S$ of both areas or
explicitly $\mathscr{P} = \kern-0.5pt \tilde{\sigma} \kern+0.5pt n \kern+1.5pt dx$ in case of $dx$ as the covered distance.
Expressing $\tilde{\sigma} = \kappa\sigma$ in terms of the inelastic scattering cross section $\sigma$ and a dimensionless factor
$\kappa$ called inelasticity, one can identify a length scale $\lambda = (\kappa\sigma n)^{-1}$ as the mean free path between
collisions. Multiplying with $\kappa$ includes the ratio of remaining to initital energy, which is taken to be constant. From this
follows a reduction in beam particles $dN \kern+0.1pt = - N \lambda^{-1} dx$ proportional to $N \kern+1.0pt$ as the total projectile
count and $\mathscr{P} = \kern-0.6pt \lambda^{-1} dx$ for the reformulated probability which represents an ordinary differential equation
of first order. The solution is found to follow an exponential law
\begin{equation*}
	N(x) \kern+0.4pt = N_0 \exp \Bigl( -\frac{\raisebox{-0.5ex}{$x$}}{\raisebox{0.5ex}{$\lambda \kern+0.3pt$}} \kern+0.5pt \Bigr)
\end{equation*}
where $N \kern+1.0pt$ particles remain over some distance $x \kern+0.5pt$ with $N_0$ as the initial amount. Furthermore,
\begin{equation*}
	P(x) \kern+0.3pt = 1 -
	\kern+0.9pt \exp \Bigl( -\frac{\raisebox{-0.5ex}{$x$}}{\raisebox{0.5ex}{$\lambda \kern+0.3pt$}}\kern+0.5pt \Bigr)
\end{equation*}
gives the probability of a particle having been scattered after travelling $x \kern+0.5pt$ length units. Similar steps
for time instead of distance lead to the well known equation
\begin{equation*}
	N(t) \kern+0.4pt = N_0 \exp \kern-2.0pt
	\raisebox{0.25ex}{\(\Bigl( \raisebox{-0.25ex}{\(-\frac{\raisebox{-0.5ex}{$t$}}{\raisebox{1.0ex}{$\tau \kern+1.0pt$}}\)}
	\kern+0.5pt \Bigr)\)}
\end{equation*}
describing exponential decay. It commonly appears in the context of radioactive materials but also applies to hadrons and leptons
or more generally any quantity which decreases at a rate proportional to itself. Analogous to the previous case, a particle
decays with probability
\begin{equation*}
	P(t) \kern+0.3pt = 1 - \kern+0.9pt \exp \kern-2.0pt
	\raisebox{0.25ex}{\(\Bigl( \raisebox{-0.25ex}{\(-\frac{\raisebox{-0.5ex}{$t$}}{\raisebox{1.0ex}{$\tau \kern+1.0pt$}}\)}
	\kern+0.5pt \Bigr)\)}
\end{equation*}
before a time $t$ has passed and for $\tau$ as the mean lifetime. Translating this from rest frame to laboratory coordinates defines
the decay timescale $t_\text{dec} \kern-0.6pt = \tau \kern+0.4pt \varGamma$ with a Lorentz factor $\varGamma = E / m$ via
projectile energy and invariant mass. This is equivalent to a characteristic decay length given by
$\lambda_\text{dec} \kern-0.5pt = v \kern+1.5pt t_\text{dec}$ where the velocity $v = c$ can be set for highly relativistic particles.
Additionally, mean free path and cooling distance $\lambda_\text{cool} = (\kappa\sigma n)^{-1}$ refer to exchangeable concepts. Particles
lose energy in every collision, which is the same as reducing temperature from a thermodynamics perspective. Dividing by the speed of
light $c$ translates this expression to $t_\text{cool} = (\kappa\sigma n \kern+0.5pt c)^{-1}$ as a cooling timescale. Analogously, the
distance $\lambda_\text{dec} \kern-0.5pt = c \kern+0.8pt \tau E / m$ can be rewritten as
$t_\text{dec} \kern-0.6pt = \tau E / m$ in units of time. Substituting into the decay formula yields a cooling factor
\begin{equation}
	\mathscr{C} = 1 - \kern+0.9pt \exp \biggl( -\frac{t_\text{cool}}{\raisebox{0.5ex}{$t_\text{dec}$}} \biggr)
	\label{eqn:cooling}
\end{equation}
which scales spectra from direct production to account for decay processes taking place after collisional energy losses have occured.
This is in some sense a core mechanism for the hypothesis that neutrinos from charm dominate pion and kaon contributions at high
energy regimes. While longer lived particles experience significant cooling due to time dilation, charmed hadron decay is prompt
in comparison. One requirement for the validity of \eqref{eqn:cooling} is that $\lambda_\text{dec} \kern-0.3pt \ll d \kern+0.5pt$
holds with a target field size $d \kern+0.5pt$ to ensure decays occur exclusive inside this region.

\section{Astrophysical Sources}
\label{sec:sources}



\subsection{Magnetic Field Scales}
\label{sub:fields}

Particles carrying electric charge $Q = Ze$ and moving at velocity $v \kern+1.0pt$ orthogonal to a homogenous magnetic field $B$ are
acted on by the Lorentz force $F = QvB$ resulting in a gyrating motion. This must then be equal to the relativistic centripetal force
$F = m \varGamma v^2 \kern-0.5pt / R$ on a circular path with $R$ as the Larmor radius. Solving by rearranging and identifying
$p = m \varGamma v \kern+0.5pt$ leads to
\begin{equation*}
	R = \frac{p}{\raisebox{0.3ex}{$QB \kern+0.3pt$}}
\end{equation*}
on which a condition $R < D$ with the magnetic field extent $D$ can be placed.


\newpage\input{amend/normal-head}


In case of highly relativistic energies one can write $E = \kern-0.8pt pc$ to replace momentum and obtain an inequality
$E < QcBD \kern+0.5pt$ from the above considerations. Realistic astrophyiscal magnetic fields are not ordered, following
turbulences travelling through the plasma instead. To incorporate effects of moving scattering centers, a factor
$\kern-0.5pt \beta \kern+0.5pt$ proportional to the Alfvén velocity is included, giving
\begin{equation}
	E < Ze \kern-0.3pt \beta \kern+0.9pt cBD
	\label{eqn:hillas}
\end{equation}
as the Hillas criterion, named after its description in \cite{Hillas_1984} to constrain source region sizes based on prevailing
magnetic fields for \abbrev{UHECR} acceleration.



\subsection{High Energy Cutoff}
\label{sub:cutoff}

At very high energies, protons and nuclei interact with cosmic photons, which can be blueshifted up to extreme gamma regimes due to
the Doppler effect. In these processes, the photon spin is absorbed to produce a delta resonance $\Delta^+$ representing an excited
proton state. This decays almost immediately to pairs of nucleons and pions, leading to $p\gamma \rightarrow \kern-0.1pt n\smash{\pi^+}$
or $p\gamma \rightarrow \kern+0.2pt p \smash{\pi^0}$ as probable reaction channels and resulting in a change of momentum for the
produced particles.

For \abbrev{CMB} radiation, a close to perfect black body spectrum has been measured with
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$dn$}}{\raisebox{0.15ex}{$d\epsilon$}} (\epsilon) \kern+0.2pt =
	\frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$\epsilon^2$}}{\pi^2 \hbar^3 c^3 \bigl( e^{\kern+1.0pt \epsilon / k_B T} - 1 \bigr)}
\end{equation*}
given by \cite{Gaisser_2016} as the photon density. This predicts that at a temperature $T \kern-0.5pt = \qty{2.725}{\kelvin}$
significant numbers of photons exist with energies around $\epsilon \kern+0.5pt = \qty{e-12}{\giga\electronvolt}$
in the \abbrev{CMB} rest frame. To find a threshold in center of mass coordinates, the scalar product is used for
\begin{equation*}
	s \kern+0.3pt = \bigl( p_{\kern-0.5pt p} + p_{\kern+0.5pt \gamma} \bigr)^2 =
	p_{\kern-0.5pt p}^2 + p_{\kern+0.5pt \gamma}^2 + 2 p_{\kern-0.5pt p} p_{\kern+0.5pt \gamma} =
	m_p^2 \kern+0.8pt c^4 \kern-0.2pt + 2 E \epsilon = \kern-0.2pt M^2c^4
\end{equation*}
where $M \kern-0.3pt = m_p + \kern+0.3pt m_\pi$ and $m_\gamma = 0$ as well as head on collisions have been assumed. The solution
\begin{equation*}
	E = \Bigl( \kern-1.0pt \bigl( m_p + m_\pi \bigr)^2 c^4 \kern-0.2pt - m_p^2 \kern+0.8pt c^4 \Bigr) / (2\epsilon)
\end{equation*}
or roughly $E \kern+1.0pt = \kern-0.5pt 10^{1 \kern-0.3pt 1} \kern+1.5pt \unit{\giga\electronvolt}$ for the so called \abbrev{GZK}
cutoff. Energies that exceed this value when viewed from \abbrev{CMB} coordinates lead to significant losses, making the universe
opaque to such protons. If pair production $\gamma \kern-0.5pt \rightarrow \smash{e^+ \kern-0.5pt e^-}$ via interaction with a
proton is considered, one finds
\begin{equation*}
	E = \Bigl( \kern-1.0pt \bigl( m_p + 2m_e \bigr)^2 c^4 \kern-0.2pt - m_p^2 \kern+0.8pt c^4 \Bigr) / (2\epsilon)
\end{equation*}
approximated to $E \kern+1.0pt = \kern-0.5pt \qty{e+9}{\giga\electronvolt}$ by setting $M \kern-0.3pt = m_p + \kern+0.3pt 2m_e$
instead. For alpha particles and heavier nuclei, similar steps apply, while electrons are limited mainly through Compton
downscattering. Additionally, there exist infrared and radio backgrounds as potentially relevant radiation fields. From
the multiple competing mechanisms for energy losses and momentum isotropization, it is as a consequence extremely challenging
to reliably interpret cosmic ray signals and practically impossible to reconstruct any information about specific sources.



\subsection{Magnetars}
\label{sub:magnetars}



\subsection{Pulsar Spindown}
\label{sub:spindown}

To explain observations of rapidly spinning neutron stars or pulsars, there has to exist some mechanism by which rotational energy is
lost. Reference \cite{Alvarez_2004} gives a brief overview of possible radiation candidates such as gravitational quadrupolar or
higher order electromagnetic moments. Because this work is limited in its scope and concerns itself with the acceleration of
electric charges, a pure magnetic dipole approach will be adopted. For more compact and convenient notation, Gaussian units are used.

In an idealized view like \cite{Deutsch_1955} of stars as sharply bound and uniformly magnetized spheres, one finds
$\mu = \kern-0.1pt R^3 B / 2$ for the external magnetic moment. The parameters $R$ and $B$ measure stellar radius and polar magnetic
flux density, respectively. In case of a rotating dipole in vacuo,
\begin{equation}
	L = \frac{2\mu^2 \omega^4 \kern-1.0pt \sin^2 \kern-2.0pt \chi \kern+1.0pt}{3c^3}
	\label{eqn:vacuum}
\end{equation}
is the exact expression for radiant power derived in \cite{Jackson_1999} as a standard reference, where a static angle
$\kern-1.0pt \chi \kern+1.0pt$ between the dipole field and rotational axis with angular frequency $\omega$ is assumed. If
instead a \abbrev{FFE} limit is applied, variational calculations \cite{Gruzinov_2006} and \abbrev{MHD} simulations
\cite{Spitkovsky_2006} indicate
\begin{equation}
	L = \frac{\mu^2 \omega^4 \raisebox{0.15ex}{\( \bigl(
	\raisebox{-0.15ex}{\( 1 \kern-0.7pt + \sin^2 \kern-2.0pt \chi \kern+1.0pt \)} \bigr) \)} }{c^3}
	\label{eqn:ffe-mhd}
\end{equation}
as an appropriate expression of the luminosity. This is likely somewhat more accurate than the previous result, as it has been
shown by \cite{Goldreich_1969} that the surroundings of a neutron star cannot support a vacuum but must instead be filled with a
plasma of charge carriers originating from instabilities at the surface. However, one immediately encounters the problem that
$\bm{E} \cdot \kern-1.0pt \bm{B} = \kern-0.5pt 0$ as a condition of force free magnetospheres prevents particle acceleration. As
\cite{Li_2012} and \cite{Gralla_2019} discuss, this can be overcome by introducing deviations from such a global solution on local
scales.

Spindown is described by an exponential energy decay $E = \kern-0.3pt E_0 \kern-0.2pt \exp \kern-2.0pt
\smash{\bigl( - \kern+0.5pt t \kern+0.1pt / \kern+0.2pt t_\text{sd} \kern+0.5pt \bigr)}$ with a characteristic timescale
$t_\text{sd}$ and $\dot{E} = - E / t_\text{sd}$ for the time derivative. Assuming all energy is stored in
rotational form, the expressions $E = \kern-0.5pt I \kern+0.5pt \omega^2 \kern-1.5pt / 2$ and
$\dot{E} = \kern-0.5pt I \kern+0.5pt \omega \kern+0.5pt \dot{\omega}$ are also valid with $I \kern+0.5pt$ as the neutron star
moment of inertia. Equations \eqref{eqn:vacuum} and \eqref{eqn:ffe-mhd} can be generalized as $L = \kern-0.5pt K \omega^4$ by
using a coefficient $K$ containing all other information except the dipolar $\omega^4$ dependence. Identifying this with the energy
loss via $\dot{E} = -L$ and evaluating at $t \kern-0.3pt= 0$ yields $L_0 \kern-0.3pt = \kern-0.2pt K \omega_0^4$ as well as
$\dot{E}_0 \kern-0.3pt = -I \omega_0^2 / 2 \kern+0.4pt t_\text{sd}$ for an expression of
$t_\text{sd} = I \kern+0.5pt / 2K\omega_0^2$ as the spindown time. It further follows for any $t \kern+0.5pt$ that
$I \kern+0.5pt \dot{\omega} = -K \omega^3$ must hold. This is a special case of the power law differential equation
$\dot{\omega} \propto \omega^n$ with $n = 3$ being the braking index characteristic of a rotating magnetic dipole. Separating
variables and integrating leads to finding
$\omega = \omega_0 \smash{\bigl( 1 + \kern+1.5pt t \kern+0.1pt / \kern+0.2pt t_\text{sd} \kern+0.5pt \bigr)^{-1/2}}$
as the time dependent frequency solution.



\subsection{Active Galactic Nuclei}
\label{sub:nuclei}



\subsection{Accretion Disks}
\label{sub:accretion}

Diffusely distributed material in orbit around a central massive object naturally produces disk like structures. This is a
consequence of gravitational forces being compensated in the radial plane by rotational effects while matter is relatively
free to collapse in the axial direction. 


\newpage\input{amend/normal-head}


Compression and friction during inward spiraling heat the disk, thereby emitting intense thermal radiation. Settings where these
phenomena likely occur are protoplanetary disks surrounding newly formed stars or accretion flows on a \abbrev{SMBH} inside the galactic
core region, among others. The following describes some related effects that are for example discussed by \cite{Longair_2011} as well.



\subsection*{Hydrostatic Equilibrium}

In Newtonian physics, the gravitational force at distance $R \kern+0.5pt$ from a mass $M \kern+0.5pt$ is given as
\begin{equation}
	F = \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$GMm$}}{R^2}
	\label{eqn:newton}
\end{equation}
for particles with masses $m$ orbiting the central object. The resulting acceleration is therefore of magnitude
$g \kern-0.3pt = GM / \smash{R^2}$ with vertical component $\ddot{z} = \kern-0.6pt g \sin(\vartheta)$ with
$\vartheta \kern+0.5pt$ as the elevation angle. In case of $\kern+0.5pt \vartheta \ll \pi / 2$ one can approximate
$\sin(\vartheta) = \kern+0.3pt z / \kern-0.2pt R \kern+0.5pt$ to obtain
\begin{equation*}
	\ddot{z} = \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$GMz$}}{R^3}
\end{equation*}
which is related to pressure $p \kern+0.5pt$ and density $\kern-0.5pt \rho \kern+0.5pt$ via
$d \kern-0.1pt p / \kern-0.1pt dz = -\rho \ddot{z} \kern+0.5pt$ for a stable equilibrium to exist. Using the speed
of sound $\smash{u^2} \kern-0.7pt = d \kern-0.1pt p / \kern-0.1pt d \kern-0.1pt \rho \kern+0.5pt$ allows reformulation to
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{d \kern-0.1pt \rho}{\raisebox{0.2ex}{$dz \kern+1.0pt$}} =
	-\rho \kern+1.0pt \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$GMz$}}{u^2R^3}
\end{equation*}
and $\rho \kern+0.6pt = \kern-0.6pt \rho_0 \kern-0.5pt \exp \kern-1.0pt \smash{\bigl( -z^2 \kern-1.8pt / 2 h^2 \bigr)}$
after integration. According to this result, the disk density follows a centered Gaussian distribution with height parameter
$h \kern+0.5pt$ defined via
\begin{equation*}
	h^2 = \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$u^2R^3$}}{\raisebox{0.2ex}{$GM \kern+1.5pt$}}
\end{equation*}
as the standard deviation. Assuming $M \gg m$ and circular Keplerian orbits, expression \eqref{eqn:newton} equals the
acting centripetal force, leading to $\smash{v^2} \kern-1.0pt = GM / R \kern+0.2pt$ for the orbital velocity. One is then
able to write $\smash{h^2 \kern-0.5pt = u^2R^2 \kern-1.5pt / v^2}$ and from condition $h \ll R$ necessary for the small angle
approximation to be valid follows $u \ll v \kern+1.0pt$ or that orbital velocities must greatly exceed the disk medium specific
speed of sound. This special case is called a thin disk and can further be extended to slim or even thick types of accretion
structures.



\subsection*{Luminosity Limit}

Any luminous object radiating with spherical symmetry excerts a pressure
\begin{equation*}
	P = \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$L$}}{4\pi R^2 c}
\end{equation*}
as a function of luminosity $L \kern+0.5pt$ at distance $R \kern+0.5pt$ from the source.
Suppose a gaseous cloud containing particles with masses $m$ falling towards the same bright central mass $M \kern+0.5pt$
due to gravitational attraction. During this process, each particle experiences $F = \kern-0.3pt \varkappa \kern+0.7pt mP \kern+0.5pt$
as an opposing radiative force where the opacity $\kern-0.3pt \varkappa \kern+0.7pt$ measures cross section per unit mass.

\newpage Balancing of \eqref{eqn:newton} and rearranging leads to the Eddington limit
\begin{equation}
	L = \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$4\pi GM c \kern+0.4pt$}}{\raisebox{0.8ex}{$\varkappa$}}
	\label{eqn:eddington}
\end{equation}
on the luminosity beyond which additional matter is immediately blown away from the central object. By assuming that infalling
material consists exclusively of ionized hydrogen, one can approximate $\varkappa \kern-0.1pt = m / \kern-0.5pt \sigma \kern+0.3pt$
with proton mass $m$ and Thomson cross section $\sigma \kern+0.5pt$ from electron scattering. Though originally applied in the
context of stellar structures, this approach can also be used to describe accretion disks. If a compact object increases its mass
with rate $\dot{M} \kern+0.5pt$ due to accreting matter, some of the corresponding gravitational potential may be converted to
radiation. In terms of rest energy, a luminosity $L = \eta\dot{M}c^2$ is obtained where $\eta$ denotes the efficiency of this
mechanism. With \eqref{eqn:eddington} one finds an analogous steady state limit
\begin{equation*}
	\dot{M} \kern-0.2pt = \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$4\pi GM$}}{\raisebox{0.8ex}{$\eta c \varkappa$}}
\end{equation*}
for the accretion rate, enforced by continuous balancing of radiation pressure and gravitational forces as a natural feedback process.



\subsection{Stochastic Acceleration}
\label{sub:acceleration}

Due to its wide applicability in different astrophysical scenarios, probabilistic collisions are often viewed as one of
the more plausible mechanisms responsible for accelerating cosmic rays to high energies. The general case is described in
\cite{Longair_2011} and supposes that for each collision, particles gain energy proportional to a constant factor $\eta$ and
remain in the region of acceleration with fixed probability $\varsigma$ on average. With initial conditions $N_0$ for the
particle number and $E_0$ as the mean energy, this results in $N \kern+0.9pt = N_0 \varsigma^k$ and $E \kern+0.9pt = E_0 \eta^k$
after $k$ collisions. Using $\ln x^k = k\ln x$~in
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\ln (N \kern+1.0pt / N_0)}{\ln (E / E_0)} = \frac{\ln(\varsigma)}{\ln(\eta)}
\end{equation*}
eliminates the exponent and by rearranging gives the relation
\begin{equation*}
	N \kern+0.9pt = N_0 \left( \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$E$}}{\raisebox{0.3ex}{$E_0$}} \right)^{\ln(\varsigma) / \kern-0.5pt \ln(\eta)}
\end{equation*}
connecting energy and number of particles. This integrated spectrum incidentally follows a power law, which is an almost
ubiquitous feature observed in cosmic ray physics. One obtains
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$dN$}}{\raisebox{0.3ex}{$dE$}} = \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$N_0$}}{\raisebox{0.3ex}{$E_0$}}
	\left( \frac{\raisebox{-0.3ex}{$E$}}{\raisebox{0.3ex}{$E_0$}} \right)^\alpha
\end{equation*}
for the differential spectrum where the spectral index
\begin{equation*}
	\alpha = \frac{\ln(\varsigma)}{\ln(\eta)} - 1
\end{equation*}
is constrained by $\ln(\varsigma) / \kern-0.5pt \ln(\eta) < 0$ due to $\varsigma < 1$ and $\eta > 1$ as implied per the definitions.

The basic case of \abbrev{DSA} considers strong shock fronts moving with velocity $\kern-0.5pt \beta = v / c \kern+1.0pt$ in a
fully ionized gas. Requiring momentum isotropization without significant energy losses on both sides of the discontinuity results
in $\ln(\varsigma) / \kern-0.5pt \ln(\eta) = -1$ for a $dN \kern+0.5pt / dE \propto \kern-0.5pt E^{\kern+0.5pt -2}$ spectral dependence
that is discussed by \cite{Longair_2011} as well. A slightly steeper index around $\alpha = \num{-2.5}$ can be derived when nonlinear
effects are accounted for to better reproduce measurements.

Energy gain increasing linearly with $\kern-0.5pt \beta \kern+1.0pt$ leads this mechanism to be categorized as Fermi type acceleration
of first order, whereas the originally proposed formulation scales like $\beta^2$ or as second order. Though shocks exceed the local
speed of sound in the astrophysical medium, relativistic velocities are typically not achieved. Consequently, ratios $\beta \ll 1$ mean
that lower order processes are much more efficient in reaching high particle energies.
