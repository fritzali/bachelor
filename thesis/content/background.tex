\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}

On their journey through space, messenger particles are subject to various influences, both in terms of type and scale,
before reaching our planet. Understanding this propagation requires a thorough comprehension of physical processes at all
scales of application, from production in astrophysical sources, through interactions with the vast radiation and matter
fields that fill the cosmos, to entering the solar system and ultimately the terrestrial atmosphere. The following sections
provide an incomplete overview of aspects relevant to the treatment of this complex topic, as well as references for further
study on the various related subjects.



\section{Particle Physics}
\label{sec:particle}

In our modern view, interactions and categories of elementary particles are most accurately described by a construct called the
\emph{Standard Model} (SM) of particle physics. Underlying this formalism is the mathematical framework known as
\emph{Quantum Field Theory}~(QF{\kern+0.5pt}T{\kern+0.5pt}) that combines and generalizes properties of
\emph{Quantum Mechanics}~(QM) and \emph{Special Relativity}~(SR) to produce a consistent description of microscopic reality.
Excitations in the associated fields are referred to as quanta and manifest themselves as observable particles.
Since this work is mostly concerned with the statistical behaviour of large quantities instead of individual particle probabilistics,
a more detailed treatment is omitted, with the exception of certain phenomena important to the justification of some later assumptions.



\subsection{Reference Frames}
\label{sub:frames}

Depending on the application, energies in particle physics are either given as viewed from a suitable rest frame or independent from
the choice of coordinates altogether. One particularly convenient formulation uses incoming and outgoing momenta
$p_1 , \kern-1.0pt p_2$ and $p_3 \kern+0.5pt , \kern-1.0pt p_4$ to define
\begin{align*}
	s = \bigl( p_1 \kern-0.5pt + p_2 \bigr)^2 \kern+0.5pt , &&
	t = \bigl( p_1 \kern-0.5pt - p_3 \bigr)^2 \kern+0.5pt , &&
	u = \bigl( p_1 \kern-0.5pt - p_4 \bigr)^2
\end{align*}
as the Mandelstam variables, which assign different channels to scattering processes based on the squared momentum carried by an
exchanged mediating particle. Implied in this context is a Minkowski inner product, making the above quantities manifestly Lorentz
invariant.
{\newpage}
When working with parametrizations defined for use in different subdisciplines it often becomes necessary to convert from center
of mass energies $\sqrt{s \kern+1.0pt} \kern+1.0pt$ to the energy $\kern-0.5pt E \kern+1.0pt$ of a projectile as viewed in the
stationary target coordinate system, where vectors $P = (E \kern+1.0pt , \bm{P} \kern+0.75pt c)$ and $p = (m c^2 \kern-1.0pt , 0)$
measure the respective particle momenta. With $\bm{P}$ denoting a classical projectile momentum, as well as rest masses $M$ and $m$
for projectile and target, the relation $E^2 = \bm{P}^2 c^2 + M^2 c^4$ leads to
\begin{equation*}
	s = (P + p)^2 = (E + m c^2)^2 - \bm{P}^2 c^2 = 2E m c^2 + \kern+1.0pt m^2 c^4 + M^2 c^4
\end{equation*}
for the invariant mass. The trailing terms in this equation become negligible at high energies, allowing for an approximation
$s = 2E m c^2$ in the target rest frame.



\subsection{Fundamental Interactions}
\label{sub:interactions}

With the theory of \emph{Quantum Electrodynamics} (QED) representing a quantized description of classical electromagnetism, the
first successful QF{\kern+0.5pt}T formulation had been realized. It governs all interactions between electrical charges that involve
photons and predicts observations with extremely high precision. Each subsequent QF{\kern+0.5pt}T is built on a foundation of QED
achievements, such as \emph{Quantum Chromodynamics} (QCD) for strong force interactions or the unified framework of
\emph{Electroweak Theory} (EWT) that includes both weak force and electromagnetic phenomena. According to the SM formalism, these
interactions are mediated by bosonic elementary particles, namely massless photons $\kern-0.5pt \gamma$ for electrodynamics or
gluons $\kern-0.5pt g$ in case of the strong force sector, as well as massive $Z$ and $W^\pm$ bosons that carry the weak force. 
The only remaining fundamental interaction not contained in the SM is gravity, the effects of which are currently best described
in terms of \emph{General Relativity} (GR{\kern+0.25pt}) as the continuous macroscopic curvature of spacetime due to the presence
of large masses. Because elementary particles exclusively inhabit microscopic scales, their behavior is usually indistinguishable
from that described by SR in flat space.
