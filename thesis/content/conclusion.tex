\chapter{Conclusion \& Outlook}
\label{ch:conclusion}

In this thesis, models of astrophysical sources are developed to estimate the relative all-flavor neutrino contribution from
decays of charmed hadrons as well as pions and kaons. To do so, analytical parametrizations for cross sections as well as spectral
distributions are taken from the literature and integrated numerically to obtain the desired results. For the scenario of a young
magnetar, results are produced by following steps described in \cite{Carpio_2020}. Large discrepancies are found and identified as
the consequence of including an optical depth






optimize procedure, already relatively flexible, can be adapted to compute more sophisticated models
